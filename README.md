This is a merging of my front end and back end repo's https://github.com/jbcastro/addcasino and https://github.com/jbcastro/casino_front for the project https://github.com/jbcastro/Tournament-Calc-Home This is a one time use form in order to add casinos to then add tournaments, so it is used for private use, not public. 

Quick Demo here https://add-casino-demo.herokuapp.com/
